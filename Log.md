    Starting knowledge:
        1. Python: some experience.
        2. Flask: no experience.
        3. SQLite: decent experience.

    Current goals: set up Python and Flask.

    AI prompts: 
        1. How do I set up Flask? https://claude.ai/share/f9b5d20a-1d5b-4e39-b979-6ea5b00f9984
            AI gave a detailed guide on how to set up my first simple Flask Application. 
            Since I have no previous experience with Flask, there is no reference point for me 
            to actually do it myself. In this case, AI was used as a source of documentation.

            AI explained the initial code required for the flask to output hello world. 
        
        3. can you explain the architecture of a flask application with examples?
            AI explained the main features of a flask framework, such as the way routes and views work.
            I decided to modify the original code to see how it works, such as creating my own views.
