My general experience when approaching development in 3 modes (no-AI baseline, full AI reliance, pedagogical assistance from AI) is similar to the experience from the 3 smaller projects.

Some insights:
1. AI is really good at giving general direction which helps a lot when planning an application, it is useful to avoid using outdated technologies and to know where one must start.
2. AI is too willing to give ready answers, constantly asking it to avoid doing so is tiresome. 
3. Internet sources often provide shallow and incomplete information on programming.
4. Using AI as a pedagogical assistance was the most comfortable and enjoyable among all 3 modes. The development went smoothly since I always had explanation and could ask very specific questions.
